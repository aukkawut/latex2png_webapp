# latex2png webapp

I need to go travel on 24 hours flight but also want to work adding latex equations to my powerpoint. So, yeah. I made this.

## How to use?

Well, this is `matplotlib` abuse along with `flask` and the `pillow`. So, if you have latex and all of those install, you should be able to just `python app,py` to run.

## Website is so bad

Well, change your template file (`templates/index.html`). I'm not a web dev nor a good programmer so yeah.
